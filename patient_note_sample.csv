"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.
In the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins","Doctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name]. I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name]. What brings you in today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have a pain in my left arm after a fall.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the fall and the pain you're experiencing?
Patient: I fell and hit my left arm about three months ago. The pain has been getting worse and I can't move my arm as well as I used to.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. I see from your medical history that you had a surgery on your left elbow for posttraumatic arthritis when you were 18. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Okay. I'd like to do a physical examination to see what's going on. Can you describe the pain you're feeling?
Patient: It's a sharp pain in my left proximal forearm.
Doctor: Alright. I'll examine your arm now. Can you move your arm for me?
Patient: No, I can't. My elbow is fused at 90 degrees and I can only do 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination.
Doctor: I see. Your motor and sensory exam is normal at the hand, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. We have taken some radiographs of your forearm and elbow. They showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: After your fall, you developed a hypertrophic nonunion of your ulnar shaft fracture, and we treated it with a cast for three months. But your motion through the nonunion site worsened, and you were unhappy with the functional limitations of your elbow arthrodesis.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: We discussed the surgical options for the ulna nonunion with you at your clinic visit three months after the fall, and we decided to proceed with conservative treatment for an additional three months.
Patient: Yes, I remember.
Doctor: Due to your prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as the risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of the nonunion and the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would act as an intramedullary device.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position and a posterior incision was performed over your elbow. We had to elevate a prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at your index procedure. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We performed a triceps splitting approach to your elbow joint and multiple buried pins were inserted.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: Is there anything you don't understand or have any questions about the procedure?
Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask.",80176,"{

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.",2024-05-14,6
"We present a case of a seventy-three-year-old Saudi man who has started visiting the primary health care center in our institution twenty-five years ago. He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.
The patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named.

Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm here because I have been concerned with having a cancer that would give me only a few days to live.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me a little more about your symptoms?
Patient: I've been feeling tired and weak, and I've been losing weight.
Doctor: Okay. We'll start by taking a detailed history and documenting your symptoms.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: And we'll also perform some physical examinations to check for any signs of cancer.
Patient: All right.
Doctor: And we'll order some radiological and pathological investigations to rule out cancer.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: After we get the results, we'll create a management plan for you based on the findings.
Patient: All right.
Doctor: The results of the investigations came back and they were all negative for cancer.
Patient: What do you mean? I'm sure I have cancer.
Doctor: I understand that you're concerned, but the tests came back negative.
Patient: I don't believe it.
Doctor: I understand that you're not satisfied with the results, so we've referred you to the Psychiatry Department to be evaluated.
Patient: What do you mean by that?
Doctor: We want to see if there might be a nonorganic cause for your symptoms, either psychological or mental.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The hospital administration has reported your case to the department of medical eligibility, addressing the issue of your continuous visits to the primary health care center with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient.

The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having a normal life and thought that his days were counted in this life. Also, a persistent refusal of any medical advice or explanation for his symptoms and fears was neither related to schizophrenia nor related to mood disorders.\nA diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder was made despite the patient's strong refusal. The family and social history evaluation also revealed a very low socioeconomic status and similar conditions in the family. Interestingly, two of the patient's daughters had similar reported conditions which could raise the suspicion of the possible genetic predisposition that could be triggered by shared environmental factors between him and his daughters. Following this extensive detailed history and evaluation, the treating psychiatrist contacted the department of medical eligibility to make the patient's file eligible again as promised by them with an unlimited eligibility to all specialties and primary care center. For the past twenty-five years of continuous hospital visiting, he has had almost weekly and even daily visits to the primary care. The patient kept complaining of variable symptoms every week and specifically asking for certain lab tests and radiological studies. Also, he successfully convinced some physicians to order a biopsy for him.\nIt is reported that physicians in the primary health care center used different techniques of counseling and they applied the biopsychosocial model to overcome the patient's fears but often failed to reach an achievement as the patient continued to complain of different symptoms and became a burden on the physician's clinic time and the hospital resources. It is also reported that the patient was extremely difficult to handle and convince. In the absence of institution guidelines to deal with such cases, all physicians tended to yield to the patient's persistent complaints and accepted his demands and fulfilled his desires by requesting whatever investigations the patient asked for. Over the years, the patient's investigations have cost approximately $178200 due to the system negligence to such cases. The patient's most requested investigations were mainly invasive radiological studies specifically abdomen and pelvis CT (18 times) and wide range of other invasive and noninvasive studies like chest CT (11 times), brain CT (7 times), chest MRI (4 times), lumbar spine MRI (6 times), and other studies. It is important here to put emphasis on the potential harms of radiation from radiological studies that are frequently requested by the patient in the absence of clear guidelines to be followed by practitioners for that group of patients. In addition, the patient asked for a variety of lab tests including renal profile, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, coronary risk profile, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, thyroid stimulating hormone, prostate specific antigen, free T4 level, and other very wide range of lab tests. Moreover, the patient underwent several biopsies like renal biopsy, prostate biopsy, gastric biopsy, and other different types of biopsies.\nThe patient was abusing the system in which resources and time were wasted. The patient kept overstepping each barrier by the hospital's staff to minimize his burden on the hospital by manipulating staff and deceiving and misleading them by giving incorrect information. Also, he was targeting junior practitioners and disturbing them and even threatened to sue the administration if restricted from health care. Five years ago, an experienced board-certified family physician was shocked when he looked at the patient's file and decided to put an effort to solve this problem by taking some actions. First action considered, after getting the approval from the family medicine department, was to limit the patient's primary care visits to only one clinic and to refer him to the supervising physician himself. Then, building strong and effective patient rapport based on trust and honesty was initiated. After negotiations, the patient agreed to enroll in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for six sessions ninety minutes each. The patient was advised to have a scheduled sleeping time, ensure healthy eating habits with regular physical exercise, be involved in social activities, stay away from stressors like searching web for symptoms, and avoid TV health shows and health magazines during active cycles of disorder. After that, there was an agreement with the patient not to disturb the clinic and he would get to see the physician regularly for checkups every three months.\nAfter five years of implementing the new rules, the patient is still visiting the clinic for regular follow-up and sometimes he breaks the rules and comes regularly to the clinic especially in active cycles of the disorder. On following the patient's condition in the last five years, it is noticed that there is a dramatic decrease in the total financial cost due to the relative decreasing number of visits, less time spent on arguing with the patient, and the filtration of his requests. Moreover, there is a remarkable improvement in the patient's condition because of CBT and relative compliance to health advice. We think that this rare case of extremely persisting illness anxiety is worth reporting because the patient managed somehow to escape attention and made a huge financial burden on hospital resources in the absence of clear guidelines in such conditions. Also, this case provides useful insight for future guidelines development.",2024-05-11,5
"The 30-year-old, gravidity 3, parity 2 patient had no medical problems during her pregnancy follow-up visits, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery. The patient had given birth to a baby weighing 3500 grams via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and she experienced heavy bleeding at day 6 after birth. The patient did not respond to medical therapies and conventional methods and underwent hysterectomy due to impaired hemodynamics caused by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with full recovery. The patient experienced active vaginal bleeding on postoperative day 10 and underwent cuff repair through the vaginal route after exploration. Possible bleeding foci that were inspected during exploration were sutured and then the patient was discharged with full recovery. However, the patient experienced recurrent abundant bleeding on postoperative day 20 for which she was hospitalized and underwent bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The patient experienced another episode of abundant bleeding on day 7 after the hypogastric artery ligation and she was then referred to our clinic. The patient’s hemodynamics was stable on initial examination. Laboratory parameters were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity. A vaginal examination revealed no bleeding. The patient experienced heavy bleeding on day 3 after admission to our clinic and she also had impairment in her hemodynamics. Her hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL and the patient was administered 4 units of erythrocyte suspension. The patient underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist was performed because no bleeding focus was detected intraoperatively, and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement. The CT scans showed findings suggestive of aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area (). The patient had ongoing bleeding and she underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic. Initial angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from the right internal iliac artery (). The artery fistula was closed with a coil. The right internal iliac artery was totally obstructed by the coil, causing intermittent bleeding after partial intraoperative ligation.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you today?
Patient: Good morning, I'm not feeling well.
Doctor: Can you tell me what's bothering you?
Patient: I've been having some heavy bleeding.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when this started?
Patient: It started about 6 days after I gave birth to my baby.
Doctor: I see. And how many times have you given birth before?

Doctor: Okay. And how was your recovery after the hysterectomy?
Patient: I was discharged after 3 days and was doing well.
Doctor: That's good to hear. And did the bleeding start again after the hysterectomy?
Patient: Yes, it did. I had to have a cuff repair.
Doctor: Okay. And did you have any more problems after the cuff repair?
Patient: Yes, I had more bleeding and had to have hypogastric artery ligation.
Doctor: Okay. And did that help with the bleeding?
Patient: I still had bleeding and was referred to your clinic.
Doctor: Okay. And what was your initial examination like when you came to our clinic?
Patient: My hemodynamics were stable and my lab parameters were normal.
Doctor: That's good. And what did the ultrasonography show?
Patient: The ultrasonography showed normal ovaries and no fluid in my abdominal cavity.
Doctor: Okay. And what did the vaginal examination show?
Patient: There was no bleeding.
Doctor: Okay. And did the bleeding start again after you were admitted to our clinic?
Patient: Yes, it did. I had heavy bleeding on the third day.
Doctor: I see. And what was your hemoglobin level at that time?
Patient: My hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL.
Doctor: Okay. And what was done about the bleeding?
Patient: I underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the result of the consultation with the radiologist?
Patient: I had a CT with contrast enhancement and it showed findings suggestive of an aneurysmal filling in my pelvic area.

}","The 30-year-old, gravidity 3, parity 2 patient had no medical problems during her pregnancy follow-up visits, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery. The patient had given birth to a baby weighing 3500 grams via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and she experienced heavy bleeding at day 6 after birth. The patient did not respond to medical therapies and conventional methods and underwent hysterectomy due to impaired hemodynamics caused by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with full recovery. The patient experienced active vaginal bleeding on postoperative day 10 and underwent cuff repair through the vaginal route after exploration. Possible bleeding foci that were inspected during exploration were sutured and then the patient was discharged with full recovery. However, the patient experienced recurrent abundant bleeding on postoperative day 20 for which she was hospitalized and underwent bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The patient experienced another episode of abundant bleeding on day 7 after the hypogastric artery ligation and she was then referred to our clinic. The patient’s hemodynamics was stable on initial examination. Laboratory parameters were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity. A vaginal examination revealed no bleeding. The patient experienced heavy bleeding on day 3 after admission to our clinic and she also had impairment in her hemodynamics. Her hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL and the patient was administered 4 units of erythrocyte suspension. The patient underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist was performed because no bleeding focus was detected intraoperatively, and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement. The CT scans showed findings suggestive of aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area (). The patient had ongoing bleeding and she underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic. Initial angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from the right internal iliac artery (). The artery fistula was closed with a coil. The right internal iliac artery was totally obstructed by the coil, causing intermittent bleeding after partial intraoperative ligation. On the second day after the intervention, the patient still had bleeding, although the amount had decreased. The patient was re-evaluated by interventional radiologists; the branches of the left uterine artery were angiographically obstructed with microparticles and the partially-ligated left internal iliac artery was totally closed by coils (). The patient received 15 units of erythrocyte suspension until the completion of the second procedure. The patient became hemodynamically stable following the procedure and had no recurrent bleeding during the follow-up period; she was discharged with full recovery on postoperative day 15.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient.",2024-05-02,7
"A 35-year-old male farmer came in contact with 11,000 volts high tension electric wire while irrigating his field. This patient was initially admitted to general surgery ward from main casualty for management as he was having open abdominal wound and was managed there for initial 3 days. He had full thickness burn wounds over the right scapula, right upper limb and anterior abdominal wall along with perforation of the intestine. There was prolapse of the intestinal loops through abdominal wound. Patient was referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days. He presented to us in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place. Details of the preliminary management were unavailable except mention of putting in catheter drain through the open abdominal wounds. There was necrosis of burned skin and muscles over the right shoulder and abdomen []. Patient was initially managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound and culture specific antibiotics. Patient responded well to the conservative management and once he was stable, a thorough debridement of the necrotic skin over the right shoulder and upper arm was performed. The area was then split skin grafted. The patient developed enterocutaneous fistula, which healed over a period of 8 weeks. The wound over the abdomen was also covered with skin graft and patient was discharged after 18 days [].
About 4 months after the discharge, the patient presented with ventral hernia and requested reconstruction of the abdominal wall.

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been having some abdominal pain.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your pain? Where is it located?
Patient: It's in my abdomen, and it's been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Well, about 4 months ago I was admitted to the General surgery ward for management. I had come in contact with a high tension electric wire while irrigating my field and got full thickness burn wounds on my right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall.
Doctor: I see. And did you have any other symptoms besides the burn wounds?
Patient: Yes, I also had a perforation of my intestine and there was prolapse of the intestinal loops through my abdominal wound.
Doctor: Okay, that's a lot to deal with. So, you were referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days of initial management, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And when you presented to us, you were in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. Do you remember what kind of management you received when you were admitted to the General surgery ward?
Patient: No, I don't remember much. I just remember that they put in a catheter drain through my open abdominal wound.
Doctor: Okay. When you were admitted to our plastic surgery unit, you had necrosis of burned skin and muscles over your right shoulder and abdomen, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And you were initially managed with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound, and culture-specific antibiotics, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And you responded well to the conservative management, and once you were stable, we performed a thorough debridement of the necrotic skin over your right shoulder and upper arm, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And after the debridement, we split skin grafted the area, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And you developed an enterocutaneous fistula, which healed over a period of 8 weeks, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And the wound over your abdomen was covered with a skin graft, and you were discharged after 18 days, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And now you're here today because you have a ventral hernia and you would like to have it reconstructed, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Okay. We plan to repair the ventral hernia by applying a synthetic mesh and reconstructing the abdominal wall with a flap cover, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And during the operation, the abdominal skin graft was separated from the peritoneum and the underlying omentum, and an inlay composite mesh was applied to secure the abdominal wall, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And after the flap failed, we debrided the area and applied two random pattern transposition skin flaps, one from the right upper abdomen and another from the left lower abdomen, is that correct?

"A 75-year-old man was seen in our orthopedic outpatient clinic with osteoarthritis of the right knee. He experienced morning stiffness, pain on the medial side of his right knee after walking and he had difficulties with full flexion of his knee. Conservative treatment was started with steroid infiltration, 4 cc lidocaine mixed with 1 cc depomedrol. Besides these complaints the patient reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.
On physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, the overlying skin appeared normal without deformities, erythema or warmth and the arterial pulsations were intact. Laboratory test results did not show any abnormalities. An X-ray did not show any bony irregularities in the tibia.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the legs revealed bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle (Figure ). There was no nidus seen on MRI so an arteriovenous form of the malformation was not plausible. Due to its asymptomatic presentation no angiogram or ultrasonography was performed to further specify the lesion. After consultation of the vascular surgeon we did not perform surgical resection or focal sclerotherapy because of the asymptomatic nature of the lesions.

"A 40-year-old Asian woman who had been in her usual state of good health was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient’s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.
Five years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed. The orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal. During the clinical course (105 months), no significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were found, even with imaging examinations, including CT and MR imaging.

Patient: I'm good, thank you.
Doctor: I see here that you came in for a regular checkup, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your checkup, we found a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to evaluate it further to determine what it is.
Patient: Okay, what do I need to do?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Unfortunately, the biopsy samples were too small to make a definitive diagnosis. We suspect that there may be multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, so we'll need to observe you closely.
Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever I need to do.
Doctor: Five years later, your CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. We also found an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

}","A 40-year-old Asian woman who had been in her usual state of good health was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient’s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.\nFive years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed. The orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal. During the clinical course (105 months), no significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were found, even with imaging examinations, including CT and MR imaging. The patient made good postoperative progress and remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.\nThe resected specimen of the lung contained a well-circumscribed solid lesion 13 mm in diameter. It was composed of fascicular architecture of bland spindle or polygonal cells (Fig. ). Neither necrotic foci nor mitotic figures were observed. The tumor was immunopositive for epithelial membrane antigen (Fig. ), D2-40, progesterone receptor, vimentin, and S100 but negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Although curettage specimens from the vertebral bone were fragmented, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were identical to those of the pulmonary lesion (Fig. ). The tumor was shown to be a transitional meningioma on histological examination, including immunohistochemical analyses (Table ).",2024-05-06,7
"The 28-year-old male patient had trained for about 2 weeks after entering a marine training center. It was said that 2-week training at the Marine training center consisted of 2–3 h of swimming training a day and 2 h of basic physical strength reinforcement training. The swimming training consisted of repetitions 50 min of swimming and 10 min of rest. The swimming portion consisted of swimming 25 m back and forth four times at full strength followed by swimming the same distance four times at low speeds. The trainees would then rest and begin again. The basic physical strength reinforcement training consisted of repeating walking and running for around 1 h followed by weight training to reinforce upper and lower extremity muscular strength. The degree of difficulty was no different for him than for his colleagues.
Due to pain in the both hip joints and the left ankle he visited a private clinic, but although a simple radiological examination was performed no abnormal finding was found (Fig. a); anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed and immobilization was recommended. At 4 weeks after enrollment, he presented at our hospital due to the aggravation of his right hip joint symptoms, a simple radiological examination was performed on the hip areas reported to be painful, and the radiographs obtained revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture (Fig. b). A bone scan showed hot uptakes at both hips and at the left ankle joint, MRI revealed fractures of both femoral necks (the right side was displaced and complete fracture) (Fig. c). He underwent open reduction and internal fixation at right hip using cannulated screws. The region of ankle joint hot uptake by bone scan was also investigated and found to be due to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint and diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus on MRI. However, the patient has never made any specific complaint regarding the ankle joint. The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively by stabilization and long leg casting.
However, reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling okay, but my hips and ankle have been hurting for a while now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing?
Patient: Sure. I have pain in both hip joints and my left ankle.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your recent physical activity?
Patient: I recently trained at a marine training center for 2 weeks. It consisted of 2-3 hours of swimming training a day and 2 hours of basic physical strength reinforcement training.
Doctor: And what did the swimming training consist of?
Patient: It was 50 minutes of swimming and 10 minutes of rest. I would swim 25 meters back and forth four times at full strength and then swim the same distance four times at low speeds.
Doctor: I see. And what about the basic physical strength reinforcement training?
Patient: It involved walking and running for about an hour and then weight training to reinforce upper and lower extremity muscular strength.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And was the difficulty level the same for you as it was for your colleagues?
Patient: Yes, it was no different for me.
Doctor: Alright. So you visited a private clinic due to the pain, correct?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: And what was the outcome of that visit?
Patient: They performed a simple radiological examination, but no abnormal finding was found. They prescribed some anti-inflammatory analgesics and recommended immobilization.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And then you presented at our hospital 4 weeks after enrollment due to the aggravation of your right hip joint symptoms, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And what did the radiographs obtained reveal?
Patient: They revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture.
Doctor: I see. And what did the bone scan show?
Patient: It showed hot uptakes at both hips and at my left ankle joint.
Doctor: And what did the MRI reveal?
Patient: It revealed fractures of both femoral necks, with the right side being a displaced and complete fracture.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And what was done to treat the right hip joint?
Patient: I underwent open reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws.
Doctor: I see. And what was the outcome of the investigation into the joint hot uptake by the bone scan?
Patient: It was found to be due to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint and diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus on MRI.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And did you make any specific complaint regarding your ankle joint?
Patient: No, I never made any specific complaint regarding my ankle joint.
Doctor: Alright. And how was your left hip and ankle joint treated?
Patient: They were treated conservatively with stabilization and long leg casting.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And was there any reduction loss noted 2 weeks after?
Patient: Yes, there was.

The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively by stabilization and long leg casting.\nHowever, reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after surgery due to non-union (Fig. a) on right hip. The displaced femur neck fracture due to fracture non union was treated by total hip arthroplasty (Depuy pinnacle cup 54 mm, ceramic liner 54–36 mm, Corail stem 314, ceramic head 12/14 medium 36 mm) and operative findings were non-specific (Fig. b).\nSuspecting multiple stress fractures, we scrutinized his history and performed a hematological examination.\nThe patient advised that he had grown in height until he was 21 years old. His body weight was 53 kg and height 170 cm, and there was no particular history of surgery or hospitalization. Seemingly, there was no finding to indicate a hormonal disorder, i.e., abnormal findings regarding early morning erection, sexual hair, etc., and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) returned a lumbar spine T score of 2.8.

"This patient is a 48 year old female who was admitted with a large fungating right breast mass which measured 22 × 20 cm and elevated 12 cm above the skin surface (Figure ). The patient stated that the mass began as a very small ""bump"" that she believed was a cyst. One year prior she had been evaluated by her primary care physician who described a bulging, red breast mass in the upper outer quadrant which measured at least 8 cm. Core biopsies were performed and the pathology revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with dominant features of carcinoma and a suggestion of carcinosarcoma. The patient chose to not undergo treatment and allowed the mass to enlarge with resultant ulceration of the mass through the skin with centralized necrosis and bleeding of the mass. The patient's associated symptoms included a 50 pound weight loss over the previous 6 months with intermittent low-grade fevers.
The patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension and left ear deafness. No significant surgical history was reported and her family history was not significant for malignancies in any first degree relatives. Physical examination revealed a cachetic female in significant pain with a large, extensively necrotic mass on the right anterolateral breast and chest wall. The necrotic tissue was on an erythematous, dense mound of tissue that extended to the lateral and central chest wall. No cervical, supraclavicular, left axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciated on physical exam. There was palpable lymphadenopathy within the right axilla.
The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a right radical mastectomy. This encompassed removal of the entire pectoralis major and minor musculature down to the right chest wall, and a complete level III axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The skin flaps were viable, not grossly involved with tumor, and were able to be closed primarily (Figure ). The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged two days later. The patient developed a moderate amount of right upper extremity chronic lymphedema.
The final pathology of the right radical mastectomy","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, I'm feeling okay, just a little bit of pain.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing?

Doctor: I see. You were admitted to the hospital for a large mass in your right breast, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the mass? When did you first notice it?
Patient: I first noticed it a year ago as a small bump that I thought was a cyst.
Doctor: I see. And did you have it evaluated by your primary care physician?
Patient: Yes, I did. They described it as a bulging, red breast mass that measured at least 8 cm.

Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: And what did the pathology reveal?
Patient: It revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with dominant features of carcinoma and a suggestion of carcinosarcoma.
Doctor: I see. And did you choose to undergo treatment?
Patient: No, I didn't. I allowed the mass to enlarge and it eventually ulcerated through the skin with centralized necrosis and bleeding.
Doctor: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms associated with the mass?
Patient: Yes, I have. I've lost 50 pounds over the previous 6 months and I've had intermittent low-grade fevers.

Doctor: And what is your family history like?
Patient: It's not significant for malignancies in any first degree relatives.
Doctor: I see. And can you describe the physical examination you underwent?
Patient: I was in a lot of pain and there was a large, extensively necrotic mass on my right anterolateral breast and chest wall. The necrotic tissue was on an erythematous, dense mound of tissue that extended to the lateral and central chest wall. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, left axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy, but there was palpable lymphadenopathy within the right axilla.

"A 19-year-old male with a history of a right tibial stress fracture with intramedullary nail fixation 14 months before presented to the emergency department after jumping into a shallow lake and immediately suffering severe right ankle pain and inability to bear weight. He had had the proximal intramedullary nail screw removed 3 months prior to presentation due to discomfort but reported no other medical problems. On exam, there was significant swelling of the ankle, with global tenderness to palpation. The fibula was noted to be displaced, as palpation of the lateral aspect of the ankle resulted in contact with the tibia, and palpation at the normal region of the peroneal groove revealed the distal fibula. Motion of the ankle was limited in all planes; however, the foot was neurovascularly intact and sensitive to light touch. A 3-view X-ray of the ankle confirmed the dislocation of the fibula posterior to the tibia and posterior dislocation of the talus, while showing the stable intramedullary nail and distal screw with no apparent lucencies (). Additionally, AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula did not reveal any fractures, and the patient did not complain of any discomfort or tenderness to palpation outside of the ankle. Closed reduction was attempted in the emergency department; the talus was relocated, but the fibula was lodged in place and unable to be reduced. Understanding that repeated attempts at closed reduction most likely be unsuccessful and to minimize the risk of articular damage, iatrogenic fracture, or skin breakdown, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction. The patient consented to open reduction and internal fixation of the fibular dislocation and was taken to the operating room the same day. The time that elapsed from injury to operation start was just under 5 hours. From the time the patient had been seen in the emergency department to operation start was under 3 hours. A lateral incision was made, and the fibula was exposed, positioned behind the tibia. At this point, a hemostat was placed between the","Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not great, I jumped into a shallow lake and hurt my ankle.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your injury?
Patient: Sure, it hurts a lot and I can't bear weight on it.
Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: I had a stress fracture on my right tibial 14 months ago and got an intramedullary nail fixation.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what happened to the screw?
Patient: I had it removed 3 months ago because it was uncomfortable.
Doctor: Okay, and have you had any other medical problems since then?
Patient: No, just this injury.
Doctor: Alright, let me take a look at your ankle. Hmm, there's significant swelling and tenderness to palpation.
Patient: Yeah, it hurts a lot.
Doctor: I see. And I also noticed that the fibula is displaced.
Patient: Really? What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the fibula is positioned behind the tibia. We need to do an X-ray to confirm this.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Alright, the X-ray confirmed the dislocation of the fibula and the talus. But there are no fractures outside of the ankle.
Patient: That's good, I guess.
Doctor: Yes, it is. We tried to do a closed reduction in the emergency room, but it was unsuccessful. So we need to do an open reduction to fix the fibular dislocation.
Patient: What's open reduction?
Doctor: It's a surgical procedure where we make an incision to access the fibula and position it back in place.
Patient: Okay, I understand.

}","A 19-year-old male with a history of a right tibial stress fracture with intramedullary nail fixation 14 months before presented to the emergency department after jumping into a shallow lake and immediately suffering severe right ankle pain and inability to bear weight. He had had the proximal intramedullary nail screw removed 3 months prior to presentation due to discomfort but reported no other medical problems. On exam, there was significant swelling of the ankle, with global tenderness to palpation. The fibula was noted to be displaced, as palpation of the lateral aspect of the ankle resulted in contact with the tibia, and palpation at the normal region of the peroneal groove revealed the distal fibula. Motion of the ankle was limited in all planes; however, the foot was neurovascularly intact and sensitive to light touch. A 3-view X-ray of the ankle confirmed the dislocation of the fibula posterior to the tibia and posterior dislocation of the talus, while showing the stable intramedullary nail and distal screw with no apparent lucencies (). Additionally, AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula did not reveal any fractures, and the patient did not complain of any discomfort or tenderness to palpation outside of the ankle. Closed reduction was attempted in the emergency department; the talus was relocated, but the fibula was lodged in place and unable to be reduced. Understanding that repeated attempts at closed reduction most likely be unsuccessful and to minimize the risk of articular damage, iatrogenic fracture, or skin breakdown, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction. The patient consented to open reduction and internal fixation of the fibular dislocation and was taken to the operating room the same day. The time that elapsed from injury to operation start was just under 5 hours. From the time the patient had been seen in the emergency department to operation start was under 3 hours. A lateral incision was made, and the fibula was exposed, positioned behind the tibia. At this point, a hemostat was placed between the fibula and tibia and used as a lever to free the fibula. The fibula was reduced in an open fashion but noted to be unstable due to syndesmotic ligament disruption. The fibula was then held in place with a Kirschner wire and fixed by placing two quadricortical screws through the tibia, using radiographic guidance to avoid the previously placed nail and remaining distal screw (). Following this, the syndesmosis was noted to be stable, and the incision was irrigated and closed. At 3 months postoperatively, the fixation continued to remain stable (). The patient underwent removal of the syndesmotic screws 4 months postoperatively, and at 6 months from the initial injury, the patient reported mild pain with activity and had full strength but was limited to approximately 10 degrees of plantar flexion. His AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was noted to be 85.",2024-05-09,1
"A 78-year-old male was admitted with acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, which was treated with venous thrombolysis. Investigation showed critical stenosis of the left ICA and 50%–69% stenosis of the right ICA on Doppler ultrasound (DUS). Angiography showed occlusion of the right ICA with reperfusion on vasa vasorum and 90% stenosis of the left ICA. The patient underwent angioplasty with stent placement in the left ICA 14 days after the episode of acute ischemic stroke []. Both the anesthetic and endovascular procedures were uneventful; the patient progressed without complaints and was discharged 2 days after the intervention. Because the patient was afebrile, and there was no active infectious focus, antibiotic prophylaxis was not given. The patient presented to the emergency department 20 days after treatment with fever. He complained of pain in the left cervical region, and a DUS of the carotid arteries was then performed, which showed only mild intimal hyperplasia within the stent.
Blood culture showed vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and the association of several septic teeth in the oral cavity, suggestive of Ludwig's angina. Antibiotic therapy was started, but the patient progressed with worsening pain in the left cervical region and formation of a subcutaneous collection with local edema. A second control DUS showed fluid in the muscle planes around the stent graft, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirmed the findings of infection at the stent site. A second cerebral angiography showed only minor irregularities at the stent site with mild intimal hyperplasia [].
The patient remained hospitalized for 3 weeks on ceftazidime and vancomycin therapy. The clinical course was stable, with a slight improvement of the cervical edema. A second cervical NMR was performed because of an increase in the cervical collection, which showed a giant pseudoaneurysm of the treated artery, a finding confirmed by angiography []. The case was discussed with the vascular surgery team, and because of contralateral ICA occlusion, bypass surgery for stent resection was not considered a good option, and neither was endovascular occlusion of the","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not great, doctor. I have been feeling quite unwell for the past few days.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me what's been bothering you?
Patient: Well, I have been experiencing fever and pain in my left cervical region.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me when you first started experiencing these symptoms?
Patient: It was about 20 days after my treatment for an ischemic stroke.
Doctor: Okay. Let me take a look at your medical history. I see that you were admitted with an acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, which was treated with venous thrombolysis.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And I see that an investigation showed critical stenosis of the left ICA and 50%–69% stenosis of the right ICA on Doppler ultrasound.

Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: I would like to see you back in the clinic in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please come back to the emergency department right away.

The case was discussed with the vascular surgery team, and because of contralateral ICA occlusion, bypass surgery for stent resection was not considered a good option, and neither was endovascular occlusion of the diseased carotid artery. Therefore, as an alternative, treatment with the placement of the Casper stent (MicroVention, CA) was suggested. This is a dual-layer braided metal stent with micro-mesh that provides greater coverage of the arterial wall. Its use was intended to achieve arterial wall reconstruction by the flow-diverting effect of the device. The course of the procedure was uneventful. Immediate results showed contrast retention within the pseudoaneurysm. Ten days later, a control angiography revealed a reduction in the pseudoaneurysm flow and volume []. However, 1 week later, a worsening of his general condition was observed, with a decreased level of consciousness, arterial hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Septicemia was diagnosed, leading to cardiac arrest and death.",2024-05-09,5
