      "The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago. On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.\n",

      "The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.\n",

      "This is an 18-month-old white male here with his mother for complaint of intermittent fever for the past five days.  Mother states he just completed Amoxil several days ago for a sinus infection.  Patient does have a past history compatible with allergic rhinitis and he has been taking Zyrtec serum.  Mother states that his temperature usually elevates at night.  Two days his temperature was 102.6.  Mother has not taken it since, and in fact she states today he seems much better.  He is cutting an eye tooth that causes him to be drooling and sometimes fussy.  He has had no vomiting or diarrhea.  There has been no coughing.  Nose secretions are usually discolored in the morning, but clear throughout the rest of the day.  Appetite is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#. His appetite has been especially poor in the past month.\n",

      "This is a 55-year-old female with a history of stroke, who presents today for followup of frequency and urgency with urge incontinence.  This has been progressively worsening, and previously on VESIcare with no improvement.  She continues to take Enablex 50 mg and has not noted any improvement of her symptoms.  The nursing home did not do a voiding diary.  She is accompanied by her power of attorney.  No dysuria, gross hematuria, fever or chills.  No bowel issues and does use several Depends a day. Recent urodynamics in April 2008, here in the office, revealed significant detrusor instability with involuntary urinary incontinence and low bladder volumes, and cystoscopy was unremarkable.\n"

      "The patient is a 68-year-old man who returns for recheck.  He has a history of ischemic cardiac disease, he did see Dr. XYZ in February 2004 and had a thallium treadmill test.  He did walk for 8 minutes.  The scan showed some mild inferior wall scar and ejection fraction was well preserved.  He has not had difficulty with chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.\n",

      "This is a 36-year-old white female who presents to the office today with a complaint of left knee pain.  She is approximately five days after a third Synvisc injection.  She states that the knee is 35% to 40 % better, but continues to have a constant pinching pain when she full weight bears, cannot handle having her knee in flexion, has decreased range of motion with extension.  Rates her pain in her knee as a 10/10.  She does alternate ice and heat.  She is using Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. and ibuprofen OTC p.r.n. with minimal relief.\n",

      "This is a return visit to the renal clinic for this patient.  She is an 85-year-old woman with history as noted above.  Her last visit was approximately four months ago.  Since that time, the patient has been considerably more compliant with her antihypertensive medications and actually had a better blood pressure reading today than she had had for many visits previously.  She is not reporting any untoward side effect.  She is not having weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She has no orthopnea.  Her exercise capacity is about the same.  The only problem she has is musculoskeletal and that pain in the right buttock, she thinks originating from her spine.  No history of extremity pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand.  It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She does a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand.  She has some pain in her thumb as well.  She thinks that could be arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007.  The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago.  The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones.  The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.  All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan.\n"

The patient's history of weight gain, central obesity, muscle mass reduction, and hypertension also increases their risk for developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders.\\n\\nFurthermore, the patient's recent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy may have complications such as adrenal insufficiency, hyperaldosteronism, or infection. Additionally, the patient's history of hip joint replacement surgery and osteonecrosis of the femoral head increases their risk for future joint-related complications, such as loosening, wear, or implant failure.\\n\\nIt is essential to closely monitor this patient's condition, including their hormonal levels, cardiovascular parameters, and joint health, to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal management of their Cushing's syndrome and other comorbidities.\", images=None, tool_calls=None))"
